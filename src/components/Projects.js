            <h2>Opportunities in Insurance Sector</h2>
            <p>
              Insurance Sector is the fastest growing industry in India. Still,
              insurance awareness in India is low and penetration is extremely
              low as compared to the Developed Countries. Post Covid, awareness
              and demand for various Life and Medical Insurance products have
              surged.

              Banks and Insurance companies have entered into partnerships where
              the banks sell the tied Insurance Companyâ€™s products to its
              clients. Many startups, Fintech companies, and Corporate Agents
              have entered this fast-growing space.
